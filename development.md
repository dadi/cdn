# DADI CDN

## Development

Bantam is based on an original concept by Joseph Denne.

Barbu was conceived, developed and is maintained by the engineering team at DADI+ ([https://dadi.co](https://dadi.co)).

Core contributors:

* Joseph Denne
* Carl Buelow

Feel free to contact the Bantam core development team on team@bant.am with questions.

### Roadmap

We will capture planned updates and additions here. If you have anything to contribute in terms of future direction, please add as an enhancement request within [issues](https://github.com/bantam-framework/barbu/issues).

Planned additions:

* ~~CSS support (obfuscation and compression)~~
* ~~JavaScript support (obfuscation and compression)~~
* ~~Cloudfront invalidation chaining~~
* ~~Multiple domain support~~
* Cluster support (master/slave API construct)
* Integration of realtime analytics covering hits, bandwidth aggregates and throughput data
* Audio and video support (we like a challenge)

### Versioning

Semantic Versioning 2.0.0

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

* MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
* MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
* PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

_Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format._

### Contributing

Very daring.

Fork, hack, possibly even add some tests, then send a pull request :)
