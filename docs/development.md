# DADI CDN

## Development

DADI is based on an original concept by Joseph Denne.

DADI CDN was conceived, developed and is maintained by the engineering team at DADI+ ([https://dadi.co](https://dadi.co)).

Core contributors:

* Carl Buelow
* James Lambie
* Arthur Mingard
* Joseph Denne

Feel free to contact the DADI core development team on team@dadi.tech with questions.

### Roadmap

We use the issues log in Github for roadmapping. If you have anything to contribute in terms of future direction, please add as an feature request within [issues](https://github.com/dadi/cdn/issues).

### Versioning

Semantic Versioning 2.0.0

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

* MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
* MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
* PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

_Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format._

### Contributing

Very daring.

Fork, hack, possibly even add some tests, then send a pull request :)
