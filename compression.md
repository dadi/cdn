# Compression

## Overview

Image compression is generally very good, vith the best results found around in the quality range of 60-40%, where we find generated images being visually indistinguishable from the source material, on average.

For heavy compression, consider adding a gentle level of blur to the image.

## Performance examples

The dimensions of the test image and of all output images is 1920 x 1080px.
